### About

This Blish HUD module relies on the [KillProof.me](https://killproof.me/) service (we recommend you sign your account up for the best experience) to help automate or assist with checking the raid "kill proofs" of members of your party.  This module is used with [Blish HUD](https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD), a Guild Wars 2 overlay.

If combined with the [Blish HUD ArcDPS Bridge](https://github.com/blish-hud/arcdps-bhud), it can automatically list members of your party that have signed up for Killproof.me so you don't have to search manually for their profile.
